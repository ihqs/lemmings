Launch demo.htm to see how lemmings Workers are run.

## To notice

Actually, only the "pi" demo is running on the lemmings API, the 2 other demos are old demos here to tests the WebWorkers apis.
They will be updated as soon as we would have a stable api for the lemmings workers

## TODO

 * test type of message to add a different behaviour in case of plain text messages
 * rewrite demos properly
 * add another funky demo
