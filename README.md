Launch demo.htm to see how lemmings Workers are run.

## To notice

Actually, only the "pi" demo is running on the lemmings API, the 2 other demos are old demos here to tests the WebWorkers apis.
They will be updated as soon as we would have a stable api for the lemmings workers

## To do

### building library

 * add identifier to workers they can send in each upcoming message in order to identify them in the master routines
 * fix issues with json (not all browsers are compatible with json messages)
 * test type of message to add a different behaviour in case of plain text messages
 * add javascript unit tests
 * simulate worker processing for olders browsers ?
 
### usability
 * minify libraries
 * comment methods
 * add documentation
 
### presentation

 * rewrite and style the demo.htm page
 * clean up demos
 * add another funky demo
